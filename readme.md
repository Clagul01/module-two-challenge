## Description

This portfolio page was created to showcase my projects and skills as a student web developer to prospective employers in the future.
The page provides a responsive layout which uses @media querie selectors so the information can be presented clearly on both phone and desktop.

By completing this project, I have learned how to use CSS variables to relay CSS attributes easily, how to use both CSS grid and flex-box properties, 
and how to make a visually appealing and well presented webpage. Dynamic elements such as smooth scrolling have also been incorporated into the page to give
visitors more ease in finding the content they are wishing to see.

## Usage

To use this webpage visit this link: https://clagul01.github.io/module-two-challenge/

Try clicking these links in the navbar to see how the smooth scroll works and be taken to the corresponding section:

When in the work section, hover over the images and see how they transform. Click on an image to be taken to the Github Pages site hosting the application I am showcasing:
